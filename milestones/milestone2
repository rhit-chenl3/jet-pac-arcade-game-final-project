milestone2 progress:

1.	Automatic movement/animation (things moving without keys pressed)  DONE 
o	The hero should fall when not on a platform (stops falling when it lands on a platform)
o	The fall should be gradual, not instantaneous
o	This movement/animation occurs without key presses

2.	Two kinds of aliens that move in a reasonable way DONE

3.	Hero shoots bullets DONE

4.	One type of alien that shoots bullets DONE

5.	Diagonal movement by hero
o	Flying diagonal movement – up arrow key in combination with left/right arrow key
o	Falling diagonal movement – left/right arrow key while falling

•	Begin planning for how your implementation will handle basic collisions (e.g., alien runs into hero and kills hero) but this will not be checked until the next milestone
